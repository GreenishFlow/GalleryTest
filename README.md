Test gallery on AS3 using BRIC algorithm.

Additional tasks:
xmlData.children().(@myVal % 2 && trace(@myVal)); - .() is running in each XMLList element that is a result from children(). That whould add all odd values in the trace cause it will be true condition. I was used it in the test project, but just for showing how it works. I'm not a fan of this, cause this is a feature that was designed for the filtration XMLList.
